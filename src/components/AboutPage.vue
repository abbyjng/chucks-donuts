      Chuck's Donuts is one of many 24-hour always-open Cambodian-owned donut
      shops in the LA area. Run by a single mother and her two daughters, we
      take pride in our family history and culture and are passionate about what
      we do here. Why donuts? We're inspired by a Cambodian pastry

      Chuck's Donuts, when originally opened, was located in what seemed like
      the ideal space - the street was bustling with activity and the nightlife
      was strong, which made the 24 hour business worthwhile. However, due to
      the housing crisis and the city declaring bankruptcy, it's not the same
      anymore, and the quiet atmosphere creates an intense space that allows for
      more deliberate situations to occur. Now, Sothy, the owner, must
      deliberate the reasons for her keeping the restaurant as it is and what it
      means to her as her history and her livelihood.

    <div class="person">
      <h3>Sothy</h3>
      <img src="./images/sothy.png" />
      <span>
        Sothy, the owner of Chuck's Donuts, is living in constant fear. After
        her ex-husband stole her money, started a second family, and left her
        with two daughters, she not only became resentful towards him but also
        constantly fears that her uncle-in-law will send someone to strike her
        down since her money was not being paid back from her loan.
      </span>
      <br />
      <span>
        This fear affects Sothy's perception of each other; she views herself as
        unworthy of having the girls around, wondering if she should send them
        to their father. She describes herself in an unflattering way, putting
        herself down when she looks at her reflection. She's a workaholic, as
        seen by her daughters' discussion of whether or not she should pick up
        smoking so that she would be forced to take more breaks. All of these
        things come from her ex-husbands actions.
      </span>
      <br />
      <span>
        However, towards the end of the story, Sothy's calmest moment is after
        she assists a woman by knocking out her abusive husband. While her two
        daughters both begin thinking of their father, her “mind stays free of
        her daughters' father” (40). Instead, she considers the woman and the
        impact that will come to her. It's as if all she needed was a
        third-party event to occur in order for her to be able to properly take
        a step back from her own situation.
      </span>
    </div>
    <div class="person">
      <h3>Tevy</h3>
      <img src="./images/tevy.png" />
      <span>
        Tevy does not miss her father; rather, she is resentful of him and his
        impact on her. Because her thinking and understanding of the world
        around her is highly analytical, she becomes especially irritated and
        frustrated when considering what it means to be Khmer. She feels like
        she has not done anything to be considered Khmer, and some of this
        feeling stems from the ways that her father likened commonplace things
        or shows to the genocide. Since she herself did not go through that in
        her lifetime, she feels disconnected from her ethnic identity.
      </span>
      <br />
      <span>
        This internal confusion pushes her to also contemplate how the
        mysterious man in their shop views his identity. She even wonders if he
        only is in Chuck's Donuts because “he feels detached from the world and
        can center himself only here, in Chuck's Donuts, around other Khmer
        people” (18). She automatically assumes he has a stronger sense of his
        own identity than she does of hers.
      </span>
      <br />
      <span>
        However, as the two girls interview the man, he reveals that he does not
        consider himself to be Khmer. Tevy confirms with him that he and his
        family had went through the Khmer Rouge, precisely the event that
        determines her own identity, yet he still does not feel connected to the
        Cambodian ethnicity. She continues to seek out reasons for which he
        could possibly not be Khmer, but comes up short due to her flawed
        understanding of the identity as a whole.
      </span>
    </div>
    <div class="person">
      <h3>Kayley</h3>
      <img src="./images/kayley.png" />
      <span>
        Out of the three women, Kayley misses her father the most and often has
        a sense of longing for a father-figure in her life. She is also the
        first one to take interest in the man who begins coming to their shop,
        as well as the first to see a resemblance between him and her father,
        something which Sothy agreed with later despite not vocalizing it. This
        longing for a father-figure makes her significantly more susceptible to
        the male gaze than her sister and mother. This is made clear through her
        observations and reactions to the man.
      </span>
      <br />
      <span>
        When he looks at them with disapproval, she likens him to her father and
        wishes she were invisible. She wonders aloud if he might be looking at
        them in the reflection of the window, rather than looking outside.
        Though she says, "'That's just so creepy,'" there is also “an
        exhilaration blooming within her” (14).
      </span>
      <br />
      <span>
        It appears that she wants the man to take an interest in them, and
        projects her idea of a father figure onto him in a somewhat grotesque
        way. Kayley, in this desire, walks the hazardous line between curiosity
        and obsession, slowly becoming attached to a stranger whom she's never
        spoken with.
